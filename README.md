This will be a project of mine where i attempt to demonstrate certain skills as I learn more about computer science &amp; coding and maybe some neuroscience skills if that ever comes up. My interest in general include coding in the scientific space but moreso back-end, data & research related. This may include writing code that optimizes how someone cleans & gets raw data ready for further processing to obtaining data from some instrument to analysis and visualization. But the most important part of this is just a place for me to show off the fruits of different free projects in the hopes that I find professional work.
